_This is rough around the edges._

Tested running on Chrome OSX with a 3.0 iPhone 3GS.

Setup
=====

* Download dependancies
    - Node.js: http://nodejs.org/#download

* Run the server: `node server`. You can specify host/port if you'd like: `node server example.com:80`.

* Point a browser at the server http://127.0.0.1:8001/. This is your "console".

* Paste `<script type="application/x-javascript" src="http://127.0.0.1:8001/ibug.js"></script>` into the page you want to debug.

* Open the page you want to debug in your browser. This is your "client".

* Type `document.body.style.background="red"` in your console window.

* BAM.
