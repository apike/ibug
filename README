_This is rough around the edges._

Tested running on Chrome OSX with a 3.0 iPhone 3GS.

Setup
=====

* Download dependancies
    - Python: http://www.python.org/download/
    - Tornado: http://github.com/facebook/tornado

* Server must run on port 80 with a hostname other than "localhost" - use 127.0.0.1 or fake out your /etc/hosts file.

* Run the iBug server: `python ibug.py` - you'll need permission to run on 80!

* Point a browser at http://your-host/firebug.html - this is your "console"

* Point your iPhone (or simulator ;) at http://your-host/test.html

* Type `document.body.style.background="red"` in your console window.

* BAM.
